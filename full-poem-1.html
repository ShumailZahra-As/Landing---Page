    <h1>The Morning Dew</h1>
    <p>In the morning light so fresh and new,<br>
        The world awakens with the dew.<br>
        Each droplet tells a tale untold,<br>
        Of nature's beauty, pure and bold.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The sun peeks over the horizon's line,<br>
        Casting rays that warmly shine.<br>
        Birds begin their morning song,<br>
        A melody that carries on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The flowers open, petals wide,<br>
        Welcoming the day with pride.<br>
        The morning breeze gently blows,<br>
        Whispering secrets the earth knows.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As the world stirs from night's embrace,<br>
        A smile spreads across its face.<br>
        For in the morning's gentle hue,<br>
        There's a promise of life anew.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With every dawn, a fresh start,<br>
        A chance to heal, a mending heart.<br>
        The morning dew, so pure, so clear,<br>
        Brings hope and joy with each new year.<br>
    </p>
