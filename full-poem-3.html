        <h1>Echoes of the Night</h1>
        In the stillness of the night,<br>
        Echoes whisper, soft and light.<br>
        Shadows dance beneath the moon,<br>
        A silent symphony, a timeless tune.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Stars adorn the velvet sky,<br>
        Glimmering like a firefly.<br>
        The world in slumber, calm and deep,<br>
        Secrets in the darkness keep.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Owls hoot in distant trees,<br>
        Carried by the gentle breeze.<br>
        Winds murmur through the leaves,<br>
        Tales of yore, the mind believes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The night unfolds its quiet grace,<br>
        A serene and sacred space.<br>
        In dreams we wander, free and far,<br>
        Guided by a shooting star.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        As dawn approaches, soft and slow,<br>
        The night prepares to let go.<br>
        Echoes fade with morning's light,<br>
        But memories linger, through day and night.<br>
    </p>
